Course Project
Mobile App Development
Spring 2018

This project was created to fulfill the requirements of my Mobile App Development class.  It is a web application that displays lists of my favorite things and allows the user to enter input of their favorites to be saved in web storage.

The application can be accessed here: file:///private/var/folders/b8/ddvn5kbs623c7l11ckzlkj8m0000gn/T/fz3temp-2/CP_Mod5_Theme.html/
